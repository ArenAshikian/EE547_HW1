# EE 547  Homework #1: Coordination Under Uncertainty  
**Spring 2026**

**Assigned:** January 14  
**Due:** Tuesday, January 27 at 23:59  


# Overview

This assignment explores foundational ideas in distributed systems, focusing on coordination, uncertainty, and durability. The problems emphasize algorithmic reasoning rather than infrastructure: no Docker, servers, or cloud services are required. All communication and persistence are simulated using local files and controlled interfaces.

The homework consists of three independent problems:

1. **Distributed Merge**  coordination via file-based message passing  
2. **Robust HTTP Client**  handling unreliable networks with retries and backoff  
3. **Durable Event Log**  persistence under reordering, duplication, corruption, and termination

Each problem is implemented separately and includes its own README explaining design choices.
